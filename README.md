## Introduction

<div align=center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yangwu91/r2g/master/images/banner.png" alt="banner"/></div>

**Reads to Genes**, or **r2g**, is a computationally lightweight and homology-based pipeline that allows rapid identification of genes or gene families from raw sequence databases in the absence of an assembly, by taking advantage of  over [44.3 petabases of sequencing data](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi) for all kinds of species deposited in  [Sequence Read Archive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) hosted by [National Center for Biotechnology Information](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), which can be effectively run on **most common computers without high-end specs**.

## Implementation

### Pulling the Docker image (recommended)

Please follow the instruction [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to download and install Docker based on your operating system before running the Docker image. This is **recommended** as it is compatible with most common operating systems including Linux, macOS and Windows.

Then, pull the r2g Docker image with all required software packages installed and configured by one command as follows:

```
docker pull yangwu91/r2g:latest
```

Now, you are good to go.

### Installing with Conda channels for Linux users

For Linux users, r2g can be installed by Conda as follows. Of course [miniconda3](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (recommended) or [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/) needs to be installed first.

```bash
# Install miniconda3:
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
# Set up bioconda channel (or its mirrors):
conda config --add channels defaults
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda config --add channels conda-forge
# Install r2g:
conda install -c yangwu91 r2g
```

After that, [Google Chrome web browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and the corresponding version of [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) (or [selenium/standalone-chrome](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium/tree/trunk/StandaloneChrome) Docker image) need to be installed.

In the future, I plan to create a pull request to the Bioconda recipes.

### Installing with Homebrew for macOS users

*TODO*:

- [x] Build Homebrew Formula
- [ ] Submit to the `brewsci/bio` Tap.

### Manual installation for all platforms

#### Required third-party applications

The r2g required 3 third-party software packages including [NCBI SRA Toolkit](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools), [Trinity](https://github.com/trinityrnaseq/trinityrnaseq), and [Google Chrome web browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) with [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) (or [selenium/standalone-chrome](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium/tree/trunk/StandaloneChrome) Docker image). 

1. NCBI SRA Toolkit

   - Download pre-built binaries for **all platforms** [here](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki/01.-Downloading-SRA-Toolkit) or compile the source code [here](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/releases) by yourself.

   * For **Linux** and **macOS** users, it also can be installed using [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) via the [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) channel:

     ```bash
     conda install -c bioconda sra-tools
     ```

     If the installed version of SRA Toolkit is above 2.10.3, before the first run you have to execute the follow command:

     ```bash
     vdb-config --interactive
     ```

     Then press `x` to set up the default configs. This is a known annoying [issue](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/issues/291) that can't be avoided.


2. Trinity

   * Follow the [instruction](https://github.com/trinityrnaseq/trinityrnaseq/wiki/Installing-Trinity) to compile the source code. Please note that Trinity has its own dependencies, including [samtools](https://github.com/samtools/samtools), [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) with [NumPy](https://numpy.org/install/), [bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml), [jellyfish](http://www.genome.umd.edu/jellyfish.html), [salmon](https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salmon.html), and [trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic). If you are a macOS user while compiling Trinity, please use `gcc` compiler instead of native `clang` complier on macOS to avoid raising errors.

   * For **macOS** users, Trinity can be installed using Homebrew as well:

     ```bash
     brew tap brewsci/bio
     brew install trinity
     ```

     

   * For **Linux** users, Trinity can be installed easily using Conda, and you would never worry about other dependencies:

     ```bash
     conda install -c bioconda trinity=2.8.5 numpy samtools=1.10
     ```

     The compatibility of Trinity **Version 2.8.5** with r2g has been fully tested, and theoretically, the later versions should work too.

3. Google Chrome web browser with ChromeDriver

   * Install [Google Chrome web browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and then download the corresponding version of [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads). 

   * Or, you can simply run [selenium/standalone-chrome](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium/tree/trunk/StandaloneChrome) Docker image in background (make sure you have the permission to bind the 4444 port on local host):

     ```bash
     docker run -d -p 4444:4444 -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm selenium/standalone-chrome
     ```


#### Installing the r2g package
The r2g package has been deposited to PyPI, so it can be installed as follows:

```
pip install r2g
```

#### Setting up the environment

If these required third-party applications above are installed using Conda, you don't need to take care of it. 

If these packages are compiled or downloaded by yourself, either include them in `$PATH` separately by a command as follows:

```
# Linux and macOS:
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/fastq-dump:/path/to/Trinity:/path/to/chromedriver"
# Windows:
set PATH=%PATH%;DRIVER:\path\to\fastq-dump;DRIVER:\path\to\Trinity;DRIVER:\path\to\chromedriver
```

or follow the prompts to set up the path to the executable files manually before the first run. And then, you are good to go.

## System requirements

The recommended minimal hardware specifications are **2-core CPU** and **4 Gb memory**, which are satisfied for most common personal computers nowadays.

## Usage

Detailed usage will be printed by the command:

```bash
docker run -it yangwu91/r2g:latest --help
```

Or:

```bash
r2g --help

```

### Specific options for running the Docker image

While executing the Docker image, some specific options are required: `-v /dev/shm:/dev/shm`, `-v /path/to/your/workspace:/workspace`, and `-u $UID`. 

* The option `-v /dev/shm:/dev/shm` shares host's memory to avoid applications crashing inside a Docker container. 

- The option `-v /path/to/your/workspace:/workspace` mounts the local directory `/path/to/your/workspace` (specify your own) to the working directory `/workspace` (don't change it) inside a Docker container, **which is the input and output directory**.

- The option `-u $UID` sets the owner of the Docker outputs. **Ignoring it will raise permission errors**.

Let's say there is a query file in FASTA format named `QUERY.fasta` in the folder `/home/user/r2g_workspace/`. As a result, the the simplest full command to run a Docker image should be:

```bash
docker run -it -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm -v /home/user/r2g_workspace:/workspace -u $UID yangwu91/r2g:latest -o OUTPUT -q QUERY.fasta -s SRXNNNNNN
```

After that, you can check out the results in the folder `/home/user/r2g_workspace/OUTPUT/`.

### An example: finding the "non-existent" *S6K* gene in a mosquito species

We applied the r2g pipeline to search the gene *S6K* (i.e. `AAEL018120` from *Aedes aegypti*, which is a well-studied species) in *Aedes albopictus* SRA experiment `SRX885420` (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX885420) using the engine `blastn`. Detailed workflow is described as follows.

#### Retrieve the sequence of a homologous gene from a well-studied species

Download nucleotide/protein sequences of *Aedes aegypti S6K* from [VectorBase](https://www.vectorbase.org/), [Ensembl](https://uswest.ensembl.org/index.html), [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore) or other online databases, and let’s say it was saved as the file `/home/user/r2g_orkspace/AAEL018120-RE.S6K.fasta`. *Aedes aegypti* is a well-studied mosquito species.

![lure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yangwu91/r2g/master/images/20191024163424.png)

#### Select a public SRA database for the species to be investigated

Select a proper SRA experiment for *Aedes albopictus* (e.g. `SRX885420`). Some genes only express in specific tissues or at specific time. Make sure the gene you are interested in indeed expresses in the SRA experiment(s) you selected.

#### Run the r2g pipeline

Run the r2g pipeline. Here, we chopped the query (`/home/user/r2g_workspace/AAEL018120-RE.S6K.fasta`) into 80-base fragments overlapping 50 bases. The command line is as follows:

```bash
docker run -it -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm -v /home/user/r2g_workspace:/workspace -u $UID yangwu91/r2g:latest -o /workspace/S6K_q-aae_s-SRX885420_c-80.50_p-blastn -s SRX885420 -q /workspace/AAEL018120-RE.S6K.fasta --cut 80,50 -p blastn
```

Or,

```bash
r2g -o /home/user/r2g_workspace/S6K_q-aae_s-SRX885420_c-80.50_p-blastn -s SRX885420 -q /home/user/r2g_workspace/AAEL018120-RE.S6K.fasta --cut 80,50 -p blastn
```

#### Review the result

The sequence file in FASTA format of the predicted *Aedes albopictus S6K* is in the folder `/home/user/r2g_workspace/S6K_q-aae_s-SRX885420_c-80.50_p-blastn/`. Please verify the sequences by the PCR amplification or other methods if necessary.
